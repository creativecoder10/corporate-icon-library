# SLNSW Corporate Icon Library

This icon library was built to work with [Icomoon](https://icomoon.io/). It can
be updated by importing the `selection.json` file as a new project, and then
exporting it out when changes have been made.

Icon set incorporates work by the following designers/developers, among others:

* Georgina Carberry
* Geoffrey Roberts

## TODO

* Tidy up naming conventions
* Standardise sizing a bit
* Add new icons
* Design and incorporate new icons for Banks etc.
